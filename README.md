UCLA CS111 - Peter Reiher Fall 2018. Operating Systems.
Assignment specs are included in their respective folders as HTML files.

Introduction to operating systems design and evaluation. Computer software systems performance, robustness, and functionality. Kernel structure, bootstrapping, input/output (I/O) devices and interrupts. Processes and threads; address spaces, memory management, and virtual memory. Scheduling, synchronization. File systems: layout, performance, robustness. Distributed systems: networking, remote procedure call (RPC), asynchronous RPC, distributed file systems, transactions. Protection and security. Exercises involving applications using, and internals of, real-world operating systems.

Note: I am currently taking this class, but I am posting my solution to the assignment at least several days after the specified submission date. 

Note #2: The primary focus of this class is NOT HTML, despite what GitHub says. The assignment specs come in the form of HTML files, but the majority of the work done in this class is in C.
