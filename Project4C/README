lab4c_tls.c ~ C source file for authenticated TLS session encryption that builds and runs on the Beaglebone, based on the remote logging appliance from part 1 of the lab.
	operates by:
		1. opening a TLS connection to the server at the specified address and port
		2. sending (and logging) your student ID followed by a newline
