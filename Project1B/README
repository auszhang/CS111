lab1b-client.c ~ A C source file implementing a client that communicates with 
the server through a socket. The user can also specify the use of twofish 
encryption or log a record of data sent over the socket.

lab1b-server.c ~ A C source file implementing a server that accepts a connection 
from a client through a socket. The server process communicates with the shell 
process via pipes, similar to project 1a. The (encrypted, if the option was 
specified) output from the shell is then written to to the socket. 

Makefile ~ The file including targets for building the tarball, along with the 
standard clean and dist options. The Makefile has distinct targets for building the
 client or building the server. 

README - A file describing the contents of the tarball

my.key - A file containing the encryption key obtained by mashing my keyboard.
