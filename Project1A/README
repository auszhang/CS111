lab1a.c
Source module in C. Supports the -shell=program option with a 
required program argument (for example, --shell=/bin/bash). This will run 
the shell located at the program file path. Input is read from the 
keyboard and is echoed to output. 

Without any options, the keyboard is put into 
non-canonical input mode with no echo. The input is read and is then
written to back the display.


Makefile
Builds the program and supports the standard default, clean and 
dist targets:

default: builds the target with the -Wall and -Wextra options.

clean: removes files created by the Makefile.

dist: creates the tarball for distribution.
